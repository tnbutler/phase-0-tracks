# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* What is a merge conflict?


Version control is software that keeps track of changes to files over time by allowing the user to safe different versions of the file as changes are made. This is useful because it makes it easy to revert back to previous versions of code, ie, when errors arise.

A branch is a direction taken in changing the contents of a respository. With a branch, a separate version of the respository is created, which allows for making changes independent of a master branch. You would use one because it allows for making changes safely.

A commit is a git command to save the contents of a respository at a specific point in time. A good commit message briefly describes changes made since the last commit.

A merge conflict occurs when git attempts to merge two branches, but the changes in question conflict with each other. This might occur if both branches have changed the same line.
