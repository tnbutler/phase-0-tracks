I will look up several short youtube videos on jquery and then use a previous html/css project in order to implement a few functions from the jquery library. I will also look at jquery code and attempt to learn what I can about what can be done.

What was most effective was coding while listening to videoes, stopping when things did not work or when they were confusing, and then looking for explanations, not always successfully.
