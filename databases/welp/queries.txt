You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT * FROM reviews join businesses ON reviews.business_id=businesses.id join users on reviews.user_id=users.id; 
1|4|McD's is great.|1|1|1|McDonalds|1|Tom|B
2|2|BK is ok.|2|3|2|Burger King|3|Rob|B
3|1|Wendys is horrible.|3|2|3|Wendys|2|Bob|B


There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT users.first_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM reviews join businesses ON reviews.business_id=businesses.id join users on reviews.user_id=users.id; 
Tom|McDonalds|4|McD's is great.
Rob|Burger King|2|BK is ok.
Bob|Wendys|1|Wendys is horrible.

How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business? 

SELECT * FROM reviews join businesses ON reviews.business_id=businesses.id join users on reviews.user_id=users.id WHERE business_id=1;
1|4|McD's is great.|1|1|1|McDonalds|1|Tom|B
