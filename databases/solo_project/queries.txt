SELECT bball_players.name, positions.position FROM bball_players JOIN positions ON bball_players.position_id=positions.id;
Curry|Shooting Guard
Shaq|Center
Duncan|Center

Delete an item that meets some condition (you can choose a condition that makes sense).

Shaq|Center
Duncan|Center

SELECT bball_players.name, positions.position FROM bball_players INNER JOIN positions ON bball_players.position_id=positions.id;
